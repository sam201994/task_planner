#### Curriculum Authoring Tool
Create a tool for teachers to author curriculum for a subject. Please watch the tool in action from the PDF/GIF included along with the task.

#### Things to Implement:
  - Row actions - Indent/ Outdent/ Delete/ Move
  - Preserve parent-child relations between nodes - moving an element should also move its children (Not done)
  - The text in each row should be editable like a text box
  - Load/ Save - Functionality to generate and download a JSON output and to load the JSON to create the structure again
  - Use React.js. No other third partly library. No need to implement Backend


#### Data structure used :
 - Array of single level objects to store data
 - `indentValues` array to store the number of indentation which gives us parent child relation
